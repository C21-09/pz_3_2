						Google LLC is an American multinational technology company
						focusing on artificial intelligence, online advertising, search engine technology, cloud
						computing, computer software, quantum computing, e-commerce, and consumer electronics. It has
						been
						referred to as "the most powerful company in the world" and as one of the world's most
						valuable
						brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and technological advantages in the field
						of
						artificial intelligence. Alongside Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta, and Microsoft, Google's
						parent company Alphabet Inc. is one of the five Big Tech companies.
					</p>
					<p class="link-item-text">
						Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists
						Larry Page and Sergey Brin
						while they were PhD students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14%
						of
						its publicly listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting
						stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was
						reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest
						subsidiary
						and is a holding company for Alphabet's internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was
						appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of
						Alphabet.
						On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.
					</p>
					<p class="link-item-text">
						The company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and
						services beyond Google
						Search, many of which hold dominant market positions. These products address a wide range of use
						cases, including email (Gmail), navigation (Waze & Maps), cloud computing (Cloud), web browsing
						(Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace), operating systems (Android), cloud
						storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage (Photos), video calling (Meet),
						smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch & Fitbit), music
						streaming
						(YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), artificial intelligence (Google Assistant &
						Bard),
						machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. Discontinued Google products
						include
						gaming (Stadia), Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.
					</p>
					<p class="link-item-text">
						Google's other ventures outside of Internet services and consumer electronics
						include quantum
						computing (Sycamore), self-driving cars (Waymo, formerly the Google Self-Driving Car Project),
						smart
						cities (Sidewalk Labs), and transformer models (Google Deepmind).
					</p>
					<p class="link-item-text">
						Google and YouTube are the two most visited websites worldwide followed by
						Facebook and X (formerly
						known as Twitter). Google is also the largest search engine, mapping and navigation application,
						email provider, office suite, video sharing platform, photo and cloud storage provider, mobile
						operating system, web browser, ML framework, and AI virtual assistant provider in the world as
						measured by market share. On the list of most valuable brands, Google is ranked second by
						Forbes[18]
						and fourth by Interbrand.[19] It has received significant criticism involving issues such as
						privacy
						concerns, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust and abuse of its monopoly
						position.

					<p class="link-item-text">
						Facebook is an online social media and social networking service owned by
						American technology giant
						Meta Platforms. Created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with four other Harvard College students and
						roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name derives
						from the face book directories often given to American university students. Membership was
						initially
						limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities. Since
						2006,
						Facebook allows everyone to register from 13 years old (or older), except in the case of a
						handful
						of nations, where the age limit is 14 years. As of December 2022, Facebook claimed 3 billion
						monthly active users. As of October 2023 Facebook ranked as the 3rd most visited website in the
						world with 22.56% of its traffic coming from the United States. It was the most downloaded
						mobile app of the 2010s.
					</p>
					<p class="link-item-text">
						Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as
						personal computers,
						tablets and smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information
						about
						themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who
						have
						agreed to be their "friend" or, with different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also
						communicate directly with each other with Messenger, join common-interest groups, and receive
						notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the pages they follow.
					</p>
					<p class="link-item-text">
						The subject of numerous controversies, Facebook has often been criticized
						over issues such as user
						privacy (as with the Cambridge Analytica data scandal), political manipulation (as with the 2016
						U.S. elections) and mass surveillance. Facebook has also been subject to criticism over
						psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem, and various controversies over
						content
						such as fake news, conspiracy theories, copyright infringement, and hate speech. Commentators
						have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the spread of such content, as well as
						exaggerating
						its number of users to appeal to advertisers.
